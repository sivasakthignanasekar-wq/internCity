The Inter-City Sports League Team Registration & Match Scheduling System is a console-based Java application developed using JDBC and Oracle Database to manage league teams, venues, and match scheduling operations.
The system allows league administrators to register teams and venues, schedule matches between teams, record match results, and retrieve fixture details. 
It ensures proper validation and enforces business rules such as preventing venue double-booking, avoiding duplicate team registrations, and restricting deletion when active fixtures exist. 
The application follows a layered architecture (App, Service, DAO, Bean, Utility) to maintain clean code structure, separation of responsibilities, and proper transaction management using commit and rollback mechanisms.
